- [x] 2025-11-18: Gear and RPM traces were separated into dedicated lanes (`index.html`, `js/charts.js`). RPM remains a simple line, gear now renders as a stepped filled graph below it. Load any lap to confirm the values no longer overlap.

✅ **Resolved** — no further action required unless we revisit combined rendering.
